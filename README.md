To run the tests, simply run the following command from the directory where the files are located:

```shell
./p4app run afdx.p4app/afdx.p4
```

The simulation will start, and give you your hand back.

For example, you can simply say that `h1` sends packets continuously with:

```shell
mininet> h1 python send_h1.py
```
